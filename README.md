# mock-up
this is the email mock up exercise.

What I have struggle the most? 

1  Place the boxes into the desidered position.
2. The background. Set the background color or image but respecting the box. I tried this hard...but I didn find the solution. :( 
3. Set the button to the desired position inside the box.
